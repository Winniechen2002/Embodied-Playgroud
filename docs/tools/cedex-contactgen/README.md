# CEDex ContactGen

[English](README.en.md) · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) · [Tool policy](../../../rules.en.md#section-8)

Minimum capability level: **L2**. Reference revision: `ef59a9fb`. [Upstream source and installation documentation](https://github.com/GeorgeWuzy/CEDex-Grasp).

Generate five-finger semantic contact candidates. Retarget to the target hand and validate IK, joint limits, collisions and task rules.

This optional tool's source, dependencies and model weights are not bundled. Provision and verify a pinned local implementation before evaluation, under its upstream terms, and declare explicit grants. A capability level alone does not make a tool available. Level 0 cannot use this prebuilt tool.

Follow the selected [observation and control permissions](../../../Vision_rules.en.md), [grasp rules](../../../rules_grasp.en.md) and [L3 read boundary](../../../rules_privileged.en.md). Higher levels grant only declared inputs, not state writes, extra resets, new tools or online downloads. Candidates require normal action, collision and task validation. Preserve source/checkpoint identity and input provenance. Additional pretrained action policies remain prohibited.
